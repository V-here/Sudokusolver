# Sudoku Solver

Developed a Sudoku Solver application using Python and backtracking algorithm.
Utilized object-oriented programming principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
Implemented a recursive approach to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles and leveraged pythonâ€™s built-in data 
structures to optimize the solving process. Achieved an accuracy of 96%.
